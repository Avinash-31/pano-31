                Are you ready to embark on an exhilarating journey of prompt engineering? Are you ready to unleash the
                power of creativity and problem-solving? Then brace yourself for this adrenaline-fueled challenge that
                will push your coding skills to the limit. <br> <br>

                ISTE Students' Chapter NIT Durgapur unveils "Code Sprint" - the ultimate coding contest, a part of
                Panorama 2k23. A one-of-a-kind event where you would use the power of ChatGPT to realise ideas through
                code. <br> <br>

                With the use of any tool on Earth (except plagiarism :)), you have only one intriguing goal: to craft a
                functional website or web app that brings to life a given problem statement within a short time.
                <br> <br>
                Date: 1st July <br>
                Time: 12:00pm - 4:00pm <br> <br>

                But wait, there's more to the rules. <br>
                1. Make sure to follow our Social media handles,
                Instagram: <a href=" https://www.instagram.com/istenitdgp/"> https://www.instagram.com/istenitdgp/</a>

                <br> <br>
                2. You might be unable to complete all the statements in a limited time. Breathe okay! There's partial
                marking for each step you accomplish. <br>
                3. Do not copy from others' code. Not even from ChatGPT directly. Get some inspiration, copy some parts
                and build on your own. <br>
                4. Do not share your code with anybody else. We'll use an automated plagiarism checker to verify the
                originality of your submission. (Yes, we are smart folks :)) <br>
                5. Pro Tip: You have quite some amazing prizes at stake. So keep pushing the limit! <br> <br>

                Gather your coding arsenal, fuel your determination, and let the sprint begin! Register Now!
